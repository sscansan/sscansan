### Hi! I am Stefano

Here I am hosting my bioinformatics and metabolomics projects!

- 🦠 I’m currently working on plant-microbiome interaction and biocontrol, metabarcoding, Microbial and population ecology, plant pathogens, and sequential yeast fermentation kinetics modeling.
- 💻 🧬 I’m learning methods and tools for genomic association, genomic prediction, classification and prediction models.
- 🌌 🛠️ Interested in bioinformatics, data analysis and visualisation.
- 👨‍💻 Working with R, Python, LaTeX, markdown, css, SQL, bash and Linux.
- 📫 Reach me out at stefanoscansani@gmail.com

Upon project completion and publication, private repositories will become public, releasing both code and data to endorse reproducible research.
